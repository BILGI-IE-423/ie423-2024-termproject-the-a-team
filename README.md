As the project group “The A Team” we are using the following data sets:

World health
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshxy/who-worldhealth-statistics-2020-complete
Global Income
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/global-income-statistics 
Meat Consumption
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagifa/meatconsumption

The main question we want to ask and gather insights for from these data sets is: How can identifying health statistics, income statistics, and consumer dietary options provide a broader perspective on regions that are more prone to infections and diseases that result in mortality?

The scope of this question covers the regions that are doing badly compared to the other regions of the world in case of infections and diseases which in the end result in the patient losing their life. Before starting our initial investigation in the data sets, our hypothesis is that areas that are considered to be economically third world countries will be prone to more infections and diseases that result in mortality. This can be due to lack of access of health services or the general lack of support for the health sector, or due to the low income values of the sector. 

The first data set of world health will be used to specify these regions using the health data.
The world health data is rather large with many different inspections for the regions. Only the data that is considered relevant will be used. Then income of the regions with high rates of morality due to infections and diseases will be considered. Finally, the dietary options will be taken into account by using the meat consumption data set. 

Another one of our hypothesis is that areas with low income values would have less meat consumption. We will detect if there is a correlation between these two data sets and see how that relates to the overall health of the region as a whole.
